# Marconi

## Building

Run the `build.sh` script to create a `build` directory which can be zipped up and shipped off. Running the script without any arguments will set the domain to `marconi.dev`. You can pass in an alternate domain name to the script, like so:

    ./build.sh newbellevueprogram.com
